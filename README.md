CT Recon in Python (crip) is an All-in-one toolkit for CT Data IO, Pre/Post-process, Physics, Dual Energy, Low Dose and everything.

:warning: crip is still under very "agile" development and **no** API consistency and correctness validation between versions are guaranteed. Use at your own risk! :construction: Check [Unit Test Coverage](https://seu-ct-recon.github.io/crip/htmlcov) to find relatively reliable functions.
